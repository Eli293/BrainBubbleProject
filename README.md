# BrainBubbleProject

“Brain Bubble” is an application project that will be available through your web browser. The project will consist of a friendly almost childlike appearance that will form ideas transmitted via the client themselves. They will have to specify what kind of project they want to brainstorm for, then they’re username, to identify them inside the database. The user will be then given a few features to put ideas unto a virtual wall inside clouds. These clouds can then be customized depending on what the client wants to categorize them as.

This type of project could benefit from an audience of all ages that are working on a new project and that need ideas on the table. This application will be free but will require a username to identify them inside the database. It could be anything, just a name to separate the visitors going in and out. Anybody that take on project whether it is in programming, art, stories, and essays will be the application’s target audience which grows more and more.
